"""Projection-profile skew estimation for ocrmypdf's deskew hook.

The classic Postl method: rotate a downscaled binarised page through
candidate angles and score how sharply ink concentrates into rows (sum of
squared differences of adjacent row-ink counts). Text lines give a strong
peak at the deskewed angle. Pure PIL + numpy so the estimator is exact to
test in CI without paddle installed.
